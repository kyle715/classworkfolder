an algorithim to add two numbers entered by the user
If i were to have two numbers (a, b) i could make a function to add a + b together and use a function such as a console log to output the function of my a + b
and make it to show the outcome of the equation.






An algorithim to find the factorial of a number entered by the user.
If i were to want to find the factorial of a number i would have to tell the computer what i mean by a "factorial" luckily the computer knows what that term means
so i would use the function for factorial. i would tell the computer to run that comand and use a variable in place of whatever number i want that function to run.
i would than make that function set an output of whatever number i were to put in place of that variable.
